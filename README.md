SNAKE-GAME

Description:
This project is a classic Snake game implemented in Java. The Snake game is a simple and timeless arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a bounded area, eating food pellets to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or with the boundaries of the playing area.

Features:
1. Snake Movement: Control the direction of the snake using arrow keys or WASD keys.
2. Food Generation: Random generation of food pellets for the snake to eat.
3. Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats a food pellet.
4. Collision Detection: Detect collisions between the snake's head and its body or the boundaries of the playing area.
5. Game Over: End the game when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries, displaying the final score.
6. User Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface for gameplay.

This project aims to provide a fun and educational implementation of a classic game in Java, suitable for beginners to learn basic game development concepts such as game loops, collision detection, and user input handling.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled program to start the game.
4. Use the arrow keys or up, down,right and left keys to control the snake's movement.
5. Eat food pellets to grow longer and increase your score.
6. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the playing area.
